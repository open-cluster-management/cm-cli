# Open Cluster Management CLI & CLI Plugin

A CLI and kubernetes CLI plugin that allows you to interact with OCM/ACM/MCE to provision and managed your Hybrid Cloud presence from the command-line.

## Requirements

Go 1.16 is required in order to build or contribute on this project as it leverage the `go:embed` tip.

## Installation

### Using releases

You can download the binary from [https://github.com/open-cluster-management/cm-cli/releases](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/cm-cli/releases)

### Using Krew

1. Install krew [https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/)
2. Plugins can be installed with the `kubectl krew install cm`

### CLI
The binary will be installed in GOPATH/bin

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-cluster-management/cm-cli.git
cd cm-cli
make build
cm
```

### Plugin
The binary will be installed in GOPATH/bin

This will create a binary `oc-cm` and `kubectl-cm` in the `$GOPATH/go/bin` allowing you to call `oc cm` or `kubectl cm`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-cluster-management/cm-cli.git
cd cm-cli
make plugin
kubectl cm
oc cm
```

## Disclaimer

This CLI (and plugin) is still in development, but aims to expose OCM/ACM's functional through a useful and lightweight CLI and kubectl/oc CLI plugin.  Some features may not be present, fully implemented, and it might be buggy!  

## Getting Started

### Setting up a ClusterPoolHost

In order to work with clusters, you need to set up `cm` with your hub cluster(s) - `cm` refers to these hubs as "clusterpoolhost"(s) or "cph"(s) for short!  

To set up your first ClusterPoolHost:
1. `oc login` to your ClusterPoolHost running [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-advanced-cluster-management-for-kubernetes), [Multicluster Engine for Kubernetes](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/backplane-operator), or [Open Cluster Management](http://github.com/open-cluster-management-io).  **Your user must be able to create ServiceAccounts in the target namespace, given that `create cph` creates a ServiceAccount.  Also ensure that ServiceAccounts in that namespace have the relevant access such as create/delete ClusterClaims, ClusterPools, etc.   We'll include a list of commmon RBAC configurations in the [RBAC Section below](#rbac-configurations).  
2. Run `cm create cph --api-server=<api-url> --console=<console-url> --group=<rbac-group> --namespace=<namespace-containing-clusters> <name-of-cph>` and run `cm create cph --help` to view all options
3. Run `cm get cph` to verify that your active clusterpoolhost is correct, `cm set cph <clusterpoolhost-name>` to set the current clusterpoolhost, `cm use cph <clusterpoolhost-name>` to switch to that clusterpoolhost's context, and `cm delete cph <clusterpoolhost-name>` to delete a ClusterPoolHost.  

### Working with Clusters

#### Using ClusterPools

ClusterPools maintain a configurable and scalable number of OpenShift clusters in a hibernating state.  `cm` exposes the capability to create, view, consume clusters from, and destroy ClusterPools.  

To create a ClusterPool, see `cm create <clusterpool/cp> --help` for all options.  You can view your created ClusterPools with `cm get <clusterpool/cp>`.

Once you have a ClusterPool, you can claim clusters from the pool for use using `cm create <clusterclaim/cc> <clusterpool-name> <clusterclaim-name>`, see `cm create <clusterclaim/cc> --help` for more options.  You can also view ClusterClaims and details with `cm get <clusterclaim/cc>` and delete ClusterClaims with `cm delete <clusterclaim/cc>`.  

Finally, you can delete a ClusterPool with `cm delete <clusterpool/cp>`.  

#### Creating Managed Clusters

To create individual clusters with specific configurations, you can use `cm create cluster`, see `cm create cluster --help` for more options, including a `values.yaml` template.  

#### Navigating around Clusters

`cm` also allows you to easily change cluster contexts without losing visibility to your Hub/ClusterPoolHost.  

To view the available clusters, use `cm get <clusterclaim/clusterpoolhost>`.  

Once you've identified a cluster, you can use `cm use <clusterclaim/clusterpoolhost> <cluster-name>` to switch to that cluster's context.  You can use these commands again to list and change contexts without losing your Hub/ClusterPoolHost context.  

`cm console <clusterclaim/clusterpoolhost>` allows you to quickly open the console of a claimed cluster or ClusterPoolHost.  

#### Hibernating/Waking Clusters

`cm` also allows you to hibernate clusters via `cm hibernate <clusterclaim/cc> <cluster-name>` and wake clusters using `cm run <clusterclaim/cc> <cluster-name>`.  

#### Bringing Clusters Under Management

If you wish to bring a cluster under the management of a hub cluster, you can use `cm attach <cluster/clusterclaim>`, see `cm attach --help` for all options.  

### RBAC Configurations

`cm` creates a ServiceAccount, named after your local system's username, on each ClusterPoolHost that you create, which provides a consistent connection to the ClusterPoolHost's API.  For `cm` to function properly, you need to give your ServiceAccount certain permissions.  We'll leave the exact permissions you wish to grant up to you, but below are the standard API objects and operations you'll interact with via `cm`, although *this list is not comprehensive*.
